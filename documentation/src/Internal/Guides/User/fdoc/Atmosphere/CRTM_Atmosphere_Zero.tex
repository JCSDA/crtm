  NAME:
        CRTM_Atmosphere_Zero
 
  PURPOSE:
        Elemental subroutine to zero out the data arrays
        in a CRTM Atmosphere object.
 
  CALLING SEQUENCE:
        CALL CRTM_Atmosphere_Zero( Atm )
 
  OUTPUTS:
        Atm:          CRTM Atmosphere structure in which the data arrays
                      are to be zeroed out.
                      UNITS:      N/A
                      TYPE:       CRTM_Atmosphere_type
                      DIMENSION:  Scalar or any rank
                      ATTRIBUTES: INTENT(IN OUT)
 
  COMMENTS:
        - The dimension components of the structure are *NOT* set to zero.
        - The Climatology, Absorber_ID, and Absorber_Units components are
          *NOT* reset in this routine.
