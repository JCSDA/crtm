           INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINE FILE CREATION FOR LBLRTM...     LNFL
   
    LNFL now accommodates the 160 character format adopted for HITRAN_2004.  
    However, the default format for LNFL will remain the 100 character format.  
    The rationale for this choice is that the vibrational data as stored in the 
    100 character format is more amenable to utlization in LBLRTM, particularly
    for LBLRTM Non-LTE calculation than that associated with the 160 character 
    format for which the vibrational information had been expanded to facilitate 
    association of the lines with the quantum mechanical vibrational designations.
   
    Presently, the capability to accomodate the 160 character format is restricted
    to TAPE1.

    Note 1: To facilitate the change to HITRAN2004 format some of the LNFL flags
    on Record 3 in older releases have been distributed to Records 3 and 4.  
    On Record 3, the flags include those that are general for the LNFL run and 
    those that are relevant to TAPE1.  On Record 4, the flags include those 
    relevant to TAPE2 only.

    Note 2: The default for blocking has been changed.  No blocking is now the 
    default. Flags NBLK1 and NBLK2 are no longer necessary and are ignored.

                                 are then merged with TAPE1 line data onto TAPE3

                              will not be included on LBLRTM line file (TAPE3)
   
                              negative value for SR(M) uses internally stored
                              default value based on tangent path through the
                              earth's atmosphere
   
                              a value of 0. for SR(M) implies no rejection for molecule M,
                              all lines for that molecule are retained
   
                              values for SR(M) are relative to LBLRTM line strengths:
                                         AFGL strengths / ( v * (1-exp(v/kT)) )
   
                              NMOL is 7 or the number of the highest molecule selected,
                              whichever is larger
