1. CONFIGURATION
================

The LBLRTM I/O tarball directory structure looks like:
 ./
  |-README  .................. this file
  |-configure  ............... configuration script
  |-Makefile.in  ............. makefile template
  `-libsrc/  ................. library source files

The build system for the LBLRTM I/O library uses an autoconf-generated
configure script.

You run the configuration script like so:

  $ ./configure --prefix=<install directory>

This command ASSUMES that the env. var. $NETCDF_DIR has been set to the location where 
netcdf-fortran and netcdf-c libraries are installed.

The --prefix switch sets the installation directory and defaults to /usr/local so
make sure you set it to a directory in which you have write access.

By default, the LBLRTM I/O library is set to read file generated from a double-precision
LBLRTM executable (what is used in the CRTM project by default). If you want to read
datafiles from a "standard" single precision LBLRTM executable, it needs to be enabled
in the configuration:

  $ ./configure --enable-single --prefix=<install directory>




2. BUILDING THE LIBRARY
=======================

To start the library build, simply type

  $ make




3. CHECKING THE LIBRARY BUILD
=============================

To run the accompanying tests using the just-built library, simply type

  $ make check

This will build and run any tests. The current output from the (successful)
test runs looks like:

4. INSTALLING THE LIBRARY
=========================

To install the library, type:

  $ make install

Installation of the library *always* occurs into its own directory within the
directory specified by the --prefix switch. The name of the installation
directory follows the convention:

  <library name>_<version>

So, if a library version (say, v1.0.0) build was configured with --prefix=$PWD
then the installation directory will be

  ${PWD}/lblrtmio_v1.0.0




5. LINKING TO THE LIBRARY
=========================

Let's assume the above install was moved into "${HOME}/local". To use the
library in your own application, the usual environment variables would be
modified something like:

  libroot="${HOME}/local/lblrtmio_v1.0.0"
  FCFLAGS="-I${libroot}/include ${FCFLAGS}"
  LDFLAGS="-L${libroot}/lib ${LDFLAGS}"
  LIBS="-llblrtmio"

(with appropriate syntax changes for csh)




6. UNINSTALLING THE LIBRARY
===========================

To uninstall the library (assuming you haven't moved the installation directory
contents somewhere else) you can type:

  $ make uninstall

This will DELETE the created installation directory. So, for a library version,
say, v1.0.0, if your configure script invocation was something like

  $ ./configure --prefix=${PWD} ...other command line arguments...

then the "uninstall" target will delete the "${PWD}/lblrtmio_v1.0.0" directory.




7. CLEANING UP
==============

Two targets are provided for cleaning up after the build. To remove all the
build products type

  $ make clean

To also remove all the configuration products (i.e. the makefiles) type

  $ make distclean




7. FEEDBACK AND CONTACT INFO
============================

That's pretty much it. Any questions or bug reports can be sent to CRTM Support.

file in your email correspondence.
